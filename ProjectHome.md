NoiseTube is a research project started in 2008 at the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris in collaboration with Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Since 2010 the project has been maintained by the Software Languages Lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
The goal of the project is to turn smartphones into mobile noise level meters to enable citizens to measure their exposure to noise in their everyday environment and participate in the collective noise mapping of their city or neighborhood.

The NoiseTube software platform that consists of a mobile application (available for Android and iOS ) and a website (visit www.noisetube.net and register an account) where users can submit their noise measurements to visualise and share them with others.

Notes:

(1) Because different phones have different microphones the app needs to be calibrated for individual models in order to produce accurate results. Currently the number of supported Android phones is quite limited. The set of supported models is expected to grow in the coming weeks and months. When new calibration settings become available they are automatically downloaded by the app.

(2) Using a memory card (or built-in secondary storage memory) is highly recommended if you want to recover your measurement data (stored as XML files) for personal use. The reason is that when you are using the phone's internal memory you may be required to have root level access on the device in order to access the data.

(3) The app has been thoroughly tested but should nevertheless be considered experimental (it may crash, but it won't damage your phone or data). If you experience problems do not hesitate to contact us.
